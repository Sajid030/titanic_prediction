# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the code and dataset for the Titanic Survival Prediction project. The project aims to build a system that predicts whether a person would have survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

## Datasets

The project utilizes two datasets:

- `train.csv`: This dataset contains the training data with features and corresponding labels.
- `test.csv`: This dataset contains the test data without labels, which will be used for predictions.
- `gender_submission.csv`: This is an example submission file showing the expected format for submitting prediction.

## Files

- `Titanic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and prediction.
- `finalized_model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained model that can be used for making predictions on new data.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
